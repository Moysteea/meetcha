# PHP Pre-requisite.
 - curl.php should be enabled in php.ini

# Deployment Steps

The following three steps must be carried out to run the app.

1. Set the key and secret of the OAuth Consumer for your Meetcha app
    - Login to Meetup.com
      - Set up a new account, if you do not have Meetup.com account
    - After login, switch to the Meetup API page (http://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/)
    - Click on 'OAuth Consumers' > 'OAuth Consumers' menu. 
    - The OAuth Consumers page lists the available OAuth Consumers created by you.
    - You can re-use key and secret of any existing OAuth Constumer, if you want. 
    - To create a new OAuth Consumer, click the 'Register OAuth Consumer' button.
    - On 'Register OAuth Consumer', provide the Consumer Name and reference to Application Website (you do not need a site for this app).
    - Click 'Register Consumer' button which will create a new OAuth Consumer.
    - Copy the key and secret of newly created OAuth Consumer.
    - Set the key and secret of the OAuth Consumer
      - Open the php/config.php file.
      - Replace the value of $key variable with the OAuth Consumer key that you generated in the previous step.
      - Replace the value of $secret variable with the OAuth Consumer secret that you generated in the previous step.
      - Save the config.php file.

2. Deploy PHP for Meetcha App and set post-authorization destination URL
You can deploy the Meetcha app and its PHP scripts on the same server, or on different servers.
    - Pre-Requisite: Download and install HTTP server that is configured to run PHP (make sure you enable Curl).
    - Deploy Meetcha App PHP folder to the server.
    - Specify post-authorization destination URL [NOTE: You can ignore these step, if PHP is deployed under Meetcha App dir]
      - Open the php/index.php file.
      - Modify the $meetcha_home_destination variable value to reference Meetcha App Home location.
      
3. Deploy Meetcha App and set serverUrl to refer to PHP scripts 
    - Pre-Requisite: Download and install HTTP server. 
    - Deploy Meetcha App to the server.
    - Specify Server URL for Meetcha PHP API
      - NOTE: You can ignore this step, if Meetcha PHP API is deployed under Meetcha App dir
      - Open the meetcha/index.html file.
      - Find the declaration for JavaScript variable 'serverUrl' and modify it to reference the URL location of 
        parent directory under which 'php' is deployed. For example, if you have deployed Meetha PHP and accessing it 
        as 'http://myserver/MeetupPhpAPI/php/index.php' then modify the value of 'serverUrl' as 'http://myserver/MeetupPhpAPI/'
      - Save the index.html file.
